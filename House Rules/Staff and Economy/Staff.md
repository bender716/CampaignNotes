 - Staff can be hired using a retainer system as described in [[Economy]]


- # Sidekicks
- Sidekicks are extremely basic characters controlled by the PC. They are built more as NPC's and lack much of the resources available to the standard PC. For example, spellcasters only get 1/4 of the spells a wizard would.
- They can be added to the character sheet using the Extra > Manage Extras > Sidekicks function. And have limited flexibility.
- They are not drawn from the general classes and consist of Expert, Spellcaster, and Warrior.
- Why they accompany you may vary but typically this character has a reason to be there for storyline reasons and may disappear.


- # Henchmen and Hirelings
 - If henchmen or hirelings accompany the party is decided by the whole group, but they are attached to the member that hired them. This is to avoid slow downs.
 - Staff loyalty is based on factors such as risk, reward, and general treatment.
	 - Calculating Loyalty Score
		 - On hiring, set the loyalty score to 7.
		 - Increase loyalty by +1 for every 100 % of their base monthly their wages are increased by. Wages paid in advance for the month.
		 - Apply the Charisma modifier of the hirer.
		 - Apply an alignment modifier of +1 for Lawful and -1 for Chaotic.
		 - Apply additional modifiers as determined by treatment:
			 - Henchmen used as cannon fodder will lose loyalty point.
			 - Henchmen who receive equipment upgrades or other rewards may gain loyalty.
	- When a henchman receives an order to do something risky or drops to half their hit points in combat, then a Loyalty check should be made on 2d6
		- If the roll is equal to or under their Loyalty Score, as determined above, then they follow the command or keep fighting. 
		- If the roll is higher than the Loyalty Score, then the henchman refuses the order or flees from combat.
			- If the action is risky they refuse and have a temporary reduction in loyalty score of -1 until the next long rest.
			- If they drop below half hit points, will either take the dodge action and hold their ground or the dash action and flee. Roll DC10 (CHA) save, on a fail they flee and take a loyalty score reduction of -1 until the next long rest.
			- If they drop below 1/4 hit points, will either take the dodge action and hold their ground or the dash action and flee. Roll DC15 (CHA) save, on a fail they flee and take a loyalty score reduction of -2 until the next long rest.
	- Henchmen who fail a loyalty check will continue working with the player based on the loyalty table below.

| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | No effect                                                                                                                                                   |
| 2     | If they are left to their own devices, roll loyalty again. If they are cared for, no effect.                                                                |
| 3     | Disadvantage on ability checks                                                                                                                              |
| 4     | Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws                                                                                                              |
| 5     | Roll loyalty again. On a fail, the hireling leaves for good. If hireling has to roll loyalty due to loss of HP, they automatically fail and leave for good. |
| 6     | Hireling leaves for good.                                                                                                                                   |
