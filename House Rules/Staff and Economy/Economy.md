- # Cost of Living
	- Cost of living prices
		- Wretched (free)
		- Squalid (1 SP/Day)
		- Poor (2 SP/Day)
		- Modest (1 GP/Day)
		- Comfortable (2 GP/Day)
		- Wealthy (4 GP/Day)
		- Aristocratic (10 GP/Day)
	- Hotels, Inns, etc. costs are based on the cost of living scale. Rooms come with meals for the day. Higher prices also come with increased access to amenities including better security. The scale is  also influenced by the availability of rooms, the wealth of the region, and the impression the innkeeper has of the character.

 
- # Staff
 Daily earnings start at 2 SP/day for subsistence living unskilled labour, but may be higher in areas without a large unskilled labour pool, or with a demand for more unskilled labour. This means minimum wage varies a bit from place to place but sits around 2 silver per day. This is quite low and constitutes having enough to live and offers little more than a place for you to sleep in relative safety with the most basic food to eat
 
 Skilled labour is more expensive and is based on the modifier level of the worker, the modifier should be determined by what you are hiring them for. See the tables below.

Henchmen require a retainer based on their proficiency modifier,
