	- Hotels, Inns, etc. costs are based on the cost of living scale. Rooms come with meals for the day. Higher prices also come with increased access to amenities including better security. The scale is  also influenced by the availability of rooms, the wealth of the region, and the impression the innkeeper has of the character.

 
In D&D 5e, the *Player's Handbook* outlines the cost of living per day under different lifestyles, ranging from Wretched to Aristocratic. These lifestyles determine how much a character spends daily to maintain their standard of living. Here’s a breakdown:

### **1. Wretched**
- **Cost:** 0 cp (0 copper pieces)
- **Description:** A wretched lifestyle means living without shelter or protection, surviving in the streets, exposed to the elements. Characters living this way might sleep in alleys, abandon buildings, or other unsafe areas.
- **Impact:** No cost is associated, but it comes with significant risks, including exposure to disease, violence, and lack of resources.

### **2. Squalid**
- **Cost:** 1 sp (1 silver piece) per day
- **Description:** A squalid lifestyle offers a little more protection than wretched, but it still involves staying in uncomfortable and unsafe places, such as flophouses or communal shelters. Food is poor quality, and living conditions are unhealthy.
- **Impact:** Basic survival with considerable discomfort and exposure to unpleasant elements.

### **3. Poor**
- **Cost:** 2 sp (2 silver pieces) per day
- **Description:** A poor lifestyle represents living on the edge of society. Characters might live in low-quality accommodations, such as small, run-down rooms or shacks. Food is simple, and personal security is still an issue.
- **Impact:** This lifestyle covers the bare necessities, but offers little in terms of comfort or safety.

### **4. Modest**
- **Cost:** 1 gp (1 gold piece) per day
- **Description:** A modest lifestyle allows for decent living conditions in a respectable part of town. Characters can afford basic food, clean clothes, and secure lodging, such as an inn or a small rented home.
- **Impact:** Comfortable living without extravagance, this lifestyle is typical for tradespeople, soldiers, and adventurers between quests.

### **5. Comfortable**
- **Cost:** 2 gp (2 gold pieces) per day
- **Description:** A comfortable lifestyle provides a good standard of living, including a private room at a quality inn, good food, and decent clothing. Characters can enjoy some of the finer things in life, such as occasional entertainment.

### **6. Wealthy**
- **Cost:** 4 gp (4 gold pieces) per day
- **Description:** A wealthy lifestyle includes luxurious living with access to the best inns, fine dining, and high-quality clothing. Characters living this way have few concerns about their day-to-day needs and can afford regular indulgences.
- **Impact:** This lifestyle is common for successful merchants, high-ranking officials, and well-paid adventurers.

### **7. Aristocratic**
- **Cost:** 10 gp (10 gold pieces) or more per day
- **Description:** An aristocratic lifestyle is the height of luxury. Characters living this way reside in opulent homes or estates, wear the finest clothes, and dine on exquisite food. They have servants, access to the best entertainment, and enjoy significant influence in society.
- **Impact:** This lifestyle is typical for nobility, wealthy merchants, and high-ranking members of society. Costs can easily exceed 10 gp per day, depending on the character’s extravagance.

### **Additional Notes:**
- **Lifestyle Expenses:** These costs cover basic living expenses such as food, shelter, and clothing. They don’t include costs for adventuring gear, transportation, or other special expenditures.
- **Role-Playing Impact:** Lifestyles can affect how NPCs perceive characters, with higher lifestyles granting more respect and influence in upper-class circles, while lower lifestyles might lead to suspicion or disdain from others.

These lifestyle costs are guidelines for maintaining a character's standard of living in a campaign and can be adjusted based on the specific setting or the DM's discretion.
