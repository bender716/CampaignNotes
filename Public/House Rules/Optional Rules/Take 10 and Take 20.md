Based on the Take 10 and Take 20 rules from 3.5 which allowed any character to take their time to accomplish any skill check if time permitted and it was safe to perform the task repeatedly until success. This replaced a player just rolling until they hit a natural 20. I am unhappy with this since it encourages not rolling as much as possible, instead

### **Revised Rules Concept**

- **Take 10**:
    
    - **Requirement**: Half proficiency (proficiency bonus divided by 2, rounded down, if that’s how you want to define it) in the skill.
    - **Narrative Rationale**: This represents a character's ability to perform routine tasks confidently and without the pressure of failure. The half proficiency requirement ensures that the character has some basic competence in the skill, reflecting that they have practiced it enough to achieve a consistent level of performance.
    - **Mechanical Impact**: Characters with at least half proficiency can perform routine tasks more efficiently, ensuring success in non-stressful situations without needing to roll the dice. This keeps the game moving while still requiring some investment in the skill.
- **Take 20**:
    
    - **Requirement**: Full proficiency in the skill.
    - **Narrative Rationale**: "Take 20" represents a character’s ability to achieve success through meticulous effort and time investment. Requiring proficiency ensures that the character has the foundational knowledge and skill needed to methodically approach the task, learning from each attempt until they succeed.
    - **Mechanical Impact**: By limiting "Take 20" to proficient characters, you preserve the value of skill specialization while still allowing for consistent success in non-stressful, time-rich environments. It encourages players to invest in skills if they want to bypass the uncertainty of dice rolls in appropriate situations.

### **Custom Ruleset: Take Rolls in Skill Checks**

This ruleset establishes guidelines for using "Take Rolls" in skill checks, balancing game mechanics with narrative realism. It provides a structured approach to handling skill checks based on a character's proficiency level, allowing for more predictable outcomes in non-stressful situations.

#### **1. General Principles**

- **Take Rolls** allow a character to bypass the randomness of rolling in skill checks, substituting a fixed number based on their proficiency level.
- **Time and Safety**: Take Rolls can only be used when there is sufficient time to perform the task and no immediate threats or pressures. If time is limited or there is an active threat, Take Rolls are not allowed, and a regular roll must be made.
- **Finality of Take Rolls**: Once a Take Roll is chosen, it represents the character's attempt at the task and cannot be rerolled unless new circumstances or significant changes occur.

#### **2. Types of Take Rolls**

1. **Take 5**:
   - **Applicable To**: Characters without proficiency in the skill.
   - **Requirement**: No proficiency required.
   - **Outcome**: The character treats their roll as a 5 on the d20.
   - **Narrative Rationale**: Represents a basic, unskilled attempt, relying on intuition or common sense. Suitable for routine, simple tasks where minimal success is sufficient.
   - **Use Cases**: Tasks like climbing a basic rope, finding common items, or making simple observations.
   - **Advantage/Disadvantage**: If you have advantage or disadvantage, you may "Take 5" and roll, choosing the higher (advantage) or lower (disadvantage) result.

2. **Take 10**:
   - **Applicable To**: Characters with at least half proficiency in the skill.
   - **Requirement**: At least half proficiency in the skill.
   - **Outcome**: The character treats their roll as a 10 on the d20.
   - **Narrative Rationale**: Represents a confident, practiced approach to the task, suitable for routine actions performed under non-stressful conditions.
   - **Use Cases**: Tasks like navigating familiar terrain, recalling common knowledge, or making steady progress in non-dangerous situations.
   - **Advantage/Disadvantage**: If you have advantage or disadvantage, you may "Take 10" and roll, choosing the higher (advantage) or lower (disadvantage) result.

3. **Take 20**:
   - **Applicable To**: Characters with full proficiency in the skill.
   - **Requirement**: Full proficiency in the skill.
   - **Outcome**: The character treats their roll as a 20 on the d20.
   - **Narrative Rationale**: Represents a meticulous, thorough approach, where the character takes the time to ensure success through careful repetition or analysis.
   - **Use Cases**: Tasks like picking locks, disarming traps, or searching for hidden compartments when there’s no time pressure.
   - **Time Requirement**: Takes 20 times the normal time to complete the task.
   - **Advantage/Disadvantage**: If you have advantage or disadvantage, you may "Take 20" and roll, choosing the higher (advantage) or lower (disadvantage) result.

#### **3. Practical Application**

- **When to Use**: Players may declare their intent to use a Take Roll at the start of a task, provided they meet the proficiency requirements and the situation allows for it (adequate time, no threats).
- **Limits of Use**: Take Rolls should be used for tasks where success is feasible with enough time and effort. The DM has the discretion to disallow a Take Roll if the task requires specialized knowledge or insight that the character lacks, or if external factors make the task impossible to complete safely or in one sitting.
- **Handling Failure**: If a Take Roll is insufficient to meet the DC of a task, the character fails the task as they would with a normal roll. The failure reflects their inability to overcome the challenge within the constraints of their skill level and the available time.

#### **4. Integrating with Existing Game Mechanics**

- **Skill Checks and Roll Substitution**: Take Rolls function as a substitute for rolling the d20 in skill checks. The final skill check result is calculated as:
  \[Take Roll + Skill Modifier\]
- **Modifiers and External Factors**: Take Rolls incorporate all relevant skill modifiers, including bonuses or penalties from abilities, conditions, or equipment. They do not bypass the impact of external factors on the skill check.
- **Decision-Making**: The choice between using a Take Roll or rolling the dice should be strategic, considering the nature of the task, the importance of the outcome, and the character’s likelihood of success with each option.

### **Conclusion**

This ruleset for Take Rolls provides a balanced approach that integrates the importance of proficiency into the mechanics, ensuring that characters perform tasks in a way that reflects their training and experience. By distinguishing between different levels of proficiency, it maintains the narrative integrity of the game world, while still allowing for streamlined gameplay in appropriate situations. The inclusion of advantage and disadvantage mechanics ensures that Take Rolls remain flexible and adaptable to a variety of in-game scenarios, making this system a valuable addition to your campaign.
### **Additional Considerations**

- **Time and Safety**: The original restrictions of "Take 20" still apply. It requires 20 times the normal time to complete the task and can only be done when there’s no immediate threat or pressure. This maintains the balance by ensuring that "Take 20" can’t be used to bypass challenges where time is of the essence or failure has consequences.
    
- **Use in Campaign Design**: You can design encounters and scenarios knowing that "Take 20" is an option, adding depth to puzzles, traps, and exploration elements. Players might decide to take their time and risk losing other opportunities or resources in exchange for a guaranteed success, adding strategic choices to the game.
    
- **Character Specialization**: By requiring proficiency, you ensure that only characters who have invested in a skill can use these options. This reinforces the importance of character choices and maintains the balance between different classes and roles within the party.
