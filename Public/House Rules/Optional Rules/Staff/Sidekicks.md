# Sidekicks
- Sidekicks are extremely basic characters controlled by the PC. They are built more as NPC's and lack much of the resources available to the standard PC. For example, spellcasters only get 1/4 of the spells a wizard would.
- They can be added to the character sheet using the Extra > Manage Extras > Sidekicks function. And have limited flexibility.
- They are not drawn from the general classes and consist of Expert, Spellcaster, and Warrior.
- Why they accompany you may vary but typically this character has a reason to be there for storyline reasons and may disappear.
