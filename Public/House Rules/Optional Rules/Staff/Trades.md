# The Trades
 Daily earnings start at 2 SP/day for subsistence living unskilled labour, but may be higher in areas without a large unskilled labour pool, or with a demand for more unskilled labour. This means minimum wage varies a bit from place to place but sits around 2 silver per day. This is quite low and constitutes having enough to live and offers little more than a place for you to sleep in relative safety with the most basic food to eat
 
 Skilled labour is more expensive. Skilled 

## Organization

In the chart below it outlines the relative availability of workers in major urban areas. These are general numbers and each trade would have its own set. For example, a city known for metal working and jewel craft might have a renowned forger, a renowned smith, and a renowned jeweler. Each would employ 5 master craftsmen, who in turn would each employ 5 journeymen, and so on from the table. This would give the city about 1800 unskilled labourers. They would fill roles as couriers, servants, apprentice assistants, waitstaff, etc.

### Economic and Social Structure:
The structure of craftsmen and their workshops in a D&D setting reflects their skill level, social standing, and the complexity of their work. Here's how different levels of craftsmen might organize their workspaces and employ staff:

#### Workforce
##### **1. Unskilled Workers**
- **Overview:** The unskilled workforce supports the day-to-day functioning of the society and are the backbone of the labor force.
- **Structure:** Typically, unskilled workers do not have their own workshops or businesses. They are often hired on a day-to-day basis by skilled craftsmen, farmers, or merchants to perform manual labor.
- **Employment:** They might work in larger projects under the supervision of a foreman or directly under a skilled worker who requires additional hands for tasks like moving materials, basic cleaning, or other menial work.
- **Skill Modifier:*** *Range:* +0 to +2
	- **Description:** Unskilled workers typically have no proficiency in specific tools or tasks. However, after years of experience, they might develop a basic competence, represented by a small ability modifier. For example, a worker who has been helping in a forge for years might have a +1 or +2 to Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks for moving heavy materials or handling simple tasks.
- **Example:** A group of unskilled laborers might be employed by a stonemason to move large blocks of stone or by a carpenter to fetch and carry materials.

##### **2. Apprentices**
- **Overview:** Represent the future of skilled labor, learning from those above them and preparing to eventually fill those roles.
- **Structure:** Apprentices typically work directly under a journeyman or master craftsman. They live and work in the master's workshop, learning the trade through hands-on experience. The master or journeyman is responsible for their training, room, and board.
- **Employment:** Apprentices handle simpler, repetitive tasks like fetching materials, preparing tools, and assisting in basic aspects of the craft. As they progress, they might be allowed to work on more complex parts of a project under close supervision.
- **Skill Modifier:** *Range:* +2 to +4 (including proficiency in relevant tools after some time)
	- **Description:** Apprentices are in the process of learning a trade, typically under a master or journeyman. They might have proficiency with a specific set of tools, but their overall skill level is still developing. For example, an apprentice blacksmith might have a +2 to +4 on Strength (Smith’s Tools) checks, reflecting their growing proficiency and ability.
- **Example:** An apprentice blacksmith might start by pumping the bellows, heating metal, and eventually move on to forging nails or simple tools under the master’s watchful eye.

##### **3. Journeymen**
- **Overview:** Provide for the general populace, creating necessary and everyday items.
- **Structure:** Journeymen have more flexibility. They may work independently, own small workshops, or be employed by a master. Those who work independently typically handle smaller commissions or routine work for the local population.
- **Employment:** Journeymen employed by masters often work on more complex projects, contributing significant skilled labor to the master's operations. They might oversee apprentices and be responsible for specific aspects of production.
- **Skill Modifier:*** *Range:* +4 to +6 (proficiency in tools, and possibly expertise in some tasks)
	- **Description:** Journeymen are fully trained and can perform their craft independently. They have proficiency with their tools and may have expertise (double proficiency) in certain areas, particularly tasks they specialize in. For instance, a journeyman carpenter might have a +5 or +6 on Dexterity (Carpenter’s Tools) checks, making them reliable for most work in their field.
- **Example:** A journeyman carpenter might be responsible for crafting furniture independently or might work in a master's workshop, focusing on detailed carving work while overseeing apprentices who handle simpler tasks.

##### **4. Masters**
- **Overview:** Serve the affluent classes, crafting high-quality goods and fulfilling important commissions.
- **Structure:** Masters typically own and operate larger workshops with multiple employees. They are well-established in their craft, often catering to wealthy clients and producing high-quality goods. A master’s workshop is usually well-organized, with areas dedicated to different stages of production.
- **Staff:** Masters often employ several journeymen and apprentices. Journeymen might manage different sections of the workshop, each responsible for a specific aspect of production. Masters oversee the entire operation, ensuring quality and managing client relationships. They also spend time teaching apprentices.
- **Skill Modifier:** *Range:* +7 to +9 (expertise in tools, plus high ability modifiers)
	- **Description:** Masters are highly skilled and experienced, often with decades of practice in their craft. They have proficiency and expertise in their tools, along with high ability modifiers due to their deep understanding of the craft. A master smith, for example, might have a +8 or +9 on Strength (Smith’s Tools) or Intelligence (Smith’s Tools) checks, reflecting their ability to produce superior work consistently.
- **Example:** A master tailor might have a workshop where apprentices handle basic sewing and cutting, journeymen work on more intricate stitching, and the master focuses on custom fittings and design for high-end clients.

##### **5. Renowned Craftsmen**
- **Overview:** Operate at a national level, their work being synonymous with prestige. They might manage large workshops or have several masters working under them.
- **Structure:** Renowned craftsmen are at the top of their profession within a region or country. They typically run large, prestigious workshops that might resemble small factories or guildhalls. These establishments are often famous, with work commissioned by nobility, wealthy merchants, or even the royal family.
- **Staff:** Their staff includes multiple masters who manage different sections of the operation, each with their own team of journeymen and apprentices. Renowned craftsmen oversee major projects, handle the most important clients, and maintain the workshop’s reputation. They might also develop new techniques or designs, which are then implemented by their team.
- **Skill Modifier:** *Range:* +10 to +12 (expertise with tools, plus legendary ability modifiers)
	- **Description:** Renowned craftsmen are recognized across the country for their exceptional skill. They might have +10 to +12 on relevant checks, combining expertise with exceptionally high ability modifiers. Their work is sought after by the elite, and they are capable of creating works of art or items of great renown. For example, a renowned tailor might have a +11 on Dexterity (Weaver’s Tools) checks, allowing them to create garments of extraordinary quality.
- **Example:** A renowned smith might run a large forge with masters handling armor, weapons, and specialized projects. The renowned smith themselves would oversee the creation of a legendary weapon or armor set commissioned by a king, with each part of the process managed by trusted masters.

##### **6. Legendary Craftsmen (Grandmasters)**
- **Overview:** Their work transcends normal boundaries, often dealing in unique or powerful items. They might have entire schools or orders dedicated to preserving their techniques, and their creations are often tied to significant historical events or legends.
- **Structure:** Legendary craftsmen, or grandmasters, are exceedingly rare and might only be found in the largest cities or at the courts of the most powerful rulers. They typically have large, specialized workshops or guilds dedicated to their craft, often involving dozens or even hundreds of workers. Their workshops might resemble small fortresses or academies, with areas dedicated to different aspects of their craft.
- **Staff:** Their staff includes multiple renowned craftsmen, each managing a large team of masters, journeymen, and apprentices. Legendary craftsmen themselves rarely engage in day-to-day production; instead, they focus on the most complex and prestigious projects, often creating works of art, magical items, or artifacts. They may also mentor other renowned craftsmen or research new techniques.
- **Influence:** These workshops might have their own supply chains, political connections, and even military protection due to the value of their work. The grandmaster’s name alone can increase the value of an item tenfold, and their creations are often the focus of legends.
- **Skill Modifier:** *Range:* +13 to +15 (expertise in tools, unparalleled ability modifiers, possibly magical enhancements)
	- **Description:** Legendary craftsmen are the pinnacle of their craft, known across multiple regions or even the entire world. They have +13 to +15 on relevant checks, combining expertise with extraordinarily high ability modifiers. Some might even have magical enhancements that further boost their skills. Their work often becomes part of legends, and they might be responsible for creating artifacts or unique magical items. For example, a legendary enchanter might have a +14 on Intelligence (Enchanter’s Tools) checks, allowing them to craft powerful and unique magical items.
- **Example:** A legendary enchanter might be commissioned to create a powerful artifact, such as a sword with magical properties. While the grandmaster oversees the entire process and performs the most critical enchantments, a team of masters and journeymen handles the crafting of the blade, the inlaying of gems, and the preparation of magical components. The grandmaster might also have a personal retinue to guard the workshop and ensure their secrets are protected.

##### **Additional Considerations:**

- **Proficiency and Expertise:** Higher-level craftsmen not only have proficiency with their tools but often have expertise, doubling their proficiency bonus on relevant checks. This reflects their deep knowledge and exceptional skill in their craft.
- **Ability Modifiers:** Ability modifiers reflect their physical or mental capabilities related to their craft. For example, a master blacksmith might have a high Strength modifier, while a renowned enchanter would have a high Intelligence modifier.
- **Specialization:** Renowned and legendary craftsmen might specialize in particular types of work, further increasing their skill in those areas, represented by even higher modifiers.

This structure provides a detailed framework for determining the cost and effectiveness of hiring different levels of craftsmen in your D&D campaign, considering both their economic impact and their in-game skill levels.

#### Guilds and Influence:
- **Guilds:** Many of these craftsmen would be members of guilds, which regulate trade, maintain standards, and protect the economic interests of their members. Masters often hold positions of influence within guilds, and renowned and legendary craftsmen might lead these organizations or even have guilds built around their techniques.
- **Apprenticeship to Mastery:** The path from apprentice to grandmaster is long and arduous, with each step requiring significant skill, time, and often a "masterpiece" to be recognized at the next level.

This hierarchical and structured approach creates a rich tapestry of craftsmanship in your D&D world, where each level of skill is supported by a network of workers and where the most skilled artisans become powerful, influential figures whose work is sought after by the elite and whose names are spoken with reverence.
