### **Stress System**

#### **Stress Values per Spell Action:**

- **Cantrip (Bonus Action):** **4 Stress Points**
  - Casting a cantrip quickly is moderately taxing.

- **Cantrip (Action):** **2 Stress Points**
  - Easier to manage with more time to focus.

- **Leveled Spell (Bonus Action):** **6 Stress Points**
  - A leveled spell cast quickly is demanding and requires significant concentration.

- **Leveled Spell (Action): 5-7 Stress Points based on level**
  - **1st-2nd Level Spell:** **5 Stress Points**
  - **3rd-4th Level Spell:** **6 Stress Points**
  - **5th Level and Above:** **7 Stress Points**
  - More powerful spells require greater focus, increasing stress.

- **Reaction Spell (Leveled or Cantrip):** **0 Stress Points**
  - Reaction spells, being instinctive responses, do not add to the caster's overall stress for the round.

#### **Total Stress Capacity per Round:**

- **Stress Capacity per Round:** **8 Stress Points**
  - This is the maximum stress a caster can handle in a single round without suffering negative effects.

### **Example Scenarios with Stress Values:**

1. **Bonus Action Leveled Spell + Action Cantrip:**
   - **Stress Calculation:** 6 (Bonus Action Leveled Spell) + 2 (Action Cantrip) = **8 Stress Points**
   - **Result:** This exactly meets the stress capacity limit, allowing the caster to perform both actions without penalty.

2. **Bonus Action Cantrip + Action Leveled Spell (1st-2nd Level):**
   - **Stress Calculation:** 4 (Bonus Action Cantrip) + 5 (1st-2nd Level Spell) = **9 Stress Points**
   - **Result:** This exceeds the 8-point stress capacity, meaning the caster would suffer a penalty if they attempt this combination.

3. **Bonus Action Leveled Spell + Action Leveled Spell (1st-2nd Level):**
   - **Stress Calculation:** 6 (Bonus Action Leveled Spell) + 5 (1st-2nd Level Spell) = **11 Stress Points**
   - **Result:** This exceeds the stress capacity by a significant margin, leading to penalties.

4. **Bonus Action Cantrip + Action Cantrip:**
   - **Stress Calculation:** 4 (Bonus Action Cantrip) + 2 (Action Cantrip) = **6 Stress Points**
   - **Result:** This is within the stress capacity, allowing the caster to perform both actions without penalty.

5. **Reaction Spell (Any Level) + Action Leveled Spell (1st-2nd Level):**
   - **Stress Calculation:** 0 (Reaction Spell) + 5 (1st-2nd Level Spell) = **5 Stress Points**
   - **Result:** This is well within the stress capacity, so the caster can perform these actions without penalty.

6. **Bonus Action Leveled Spell + Reaction Spell (Any Level):**
   - **Stress Calculation:** 6 (Bonus Action Leveled Spell) + 0 (Reaction Spell) = **6 Stress Points**
   - **Result:** This is within the stress capacity, allowing the caster to perform both actions without penalty.

### **Penalties for Exceeding Stress Capacity:**

If a caster attempts to exceed their stress capacity in a round, they suffer immediate consequences:

- **Immediate Exhaustion:** The caster gains 1 level of exhaustion.
- **Arcane Backlash:** The caster takes 2d6 force damage per point of stress over the limit.
- **Spell Failure:** The second spell automatically fails, and the caster loses the spell slot (if applicable).
- **Wild Magic Surge:** Roll on the Wild Magic table if stress exceeds the limit by more than 2 points.

Absolutely, removing the automatic spell failure and focusing on giving players the option to push their limits with significant risks makes for a more dynamic and player-agency-driven system. Here’s a refined version of the penalties without the spell failure component:

### **Penalties for Exceeding Stress Capacity**

When a caster exceeds the stress capacity of **8 points** in a single round, they face the following escalating penalties. These penalties provide serious risks while still allowing players the option to push their magical limits:

1. **Disruption of Magical Aura:**
   - After exceeding the stress capacity, the caster’s magical aura becomes unstable for the next minute. During this time, all spellcasting attempts have a **25% chance of failure** (rolling a d20; on a roll of 5 or lower, the spell fails). This temporary instability reflects the ongoing difficulty in controlling their magic after pushing beyond safe limits.
2. **Arcane Backlash:**
   - The caster takes **2d6 force damage** per point of stress over the limit. This damage represents the intense, uncontrolled magical energy rebounding onto the caster, causing immediate harm.
3. **Immediate Exhaustion:**
   - The caster gains **1 level of exhaustion** for every 2 points by which they exceed the stress limit. This reflects the significant toll on their physical and mental endurance.
4. **Wild Magic Surge:**
   - If the caster exceeds the stress capacity by more than 3 points, they must roll on the **Wild Magic table**. This surge symbolizes the chaotic and unpredictable consequences of overloading their magical capabilities.

### **Summary of the Refined System:**

This system gives players the choice to push their characters to the brink in exchange for potentially powerful actions. The penalties are significant but do not outright prevent the caster from taking further actions, thus preserving player agency and allowing for high-risk, high-reward scenarios.

This approach encourages strategic decision-making and offers meaningful consequences for overextending magical abilities while still allowing players to make bold choices in critical moments.
