# Fylazion's Notes

## GitHub
I have elected to utilize a public GitHub repository for the purposes of storing most of my notes for reference by myself and other members of the table. This has issues arising from potential legalities. My notes tend to be very in depth, to the point I do not require the actual book with me to reference in most cases. As such, there is a potential copyright issue with storying the entire vault online. To mitigate this issue, I have created a folder which contains protected content. My world content, which I can share, is stored in the world folder, for player reference, but if the content is created by someone else, it is stored in the Protected Content folder which is not shared.

## DM Tools
This section contains notes with information to help you run a session but is aimed at either providing shortcuts to important information stored here or online, or providing tools like initiative trackers to make life easier if you do not have another tool to perform that task.

## Help
The help folder contains material and references for running a campaign in general terms as well as operating the Obsidian vault for the campaign.

## House Rules
House Rules contains homebrew rules and notes on rulings for reference.

## Protected Content
This section is for material that shouldn't be shared with the general public due to copyright control issues. PDFs and other files can be placed here but this folder should be kept local. If an item needs to be described in a manner that may violate copyright, create a note here and link to it where you need to. Or link to the original content stored online or elsewhere instead.

## Sessions
This is where session notes are stored. 

## World
This contains the world building details describing people places and things. Its focus is on the people, places, and events that take place in the world the game takes place in, not on tools. It is probably best for a GM not to share this, as plot and planning has a home here.
