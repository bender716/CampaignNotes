- # Time
- Scheduling
- Length of Sessions
- Dealing with player cancellations
- Snacks and Food

- # Place
- Where will sessions take place
- Dealing with players who cannot make it to the location, AKA remote play options
- Environmental factors constricting play style in and out of character

- # What is allowed
- Alcoholic beverages
- Respect each other, what topics should be avoided

- # The Game
- What is the campaign going to be like. Module or Homebrew? More linear or more open-world sandbox?
- What is the setting? Combat vs. RP balance? Urban, rural, wilderness, underdark, etc.?
- Survival, encumberance, etc.?
- How is leveling handled? Milestone vs. XP. If using experience points, how is roleplaying taken into consideration? How do different actions impact the game overall? If less XP is given for RP than killing, it will incentive kill first, talk later but this may result in other consequences later on. Will players level up immediately when conditions are met or will they need to visit a trainer or something?

- # Table Rules
- What are the exact house rules, if any?
- How are rule disputes handled? Is there room for debate and if so, when should that take place?
- If the players cannot debate rulings, how will it be made so the players don't feel like it is a dictatorship?
- How is PC death handled? How often is it expected to happen and what can cause it?
- Can players act against each others interests and to what degree?
- How are phones and other distractions handled? 
- How is players distracting other players handled?
- How are player rolls handled? Open roll or trust? Are hidden rolls by players required in certain instances and how are those handled?

- # Hard Topics
- Deal with these delicately and in a one-on-one setting if need be. Some topics are very personal.
- These can include various things but a common theme is topics that may result in increased ratings on movies or trigger warnings in literature.
- Rascism and sex (consensual or not) are particular topics that should be addressed.
- Gore, what degree of graphic description in combat is acceptable.

- # Making Characters
- Are any races off-limits? If so why and can a player work with you to make that race happen? 
- **_This is something that many DMs forget. Don’t forget this step or the perfect session 0 D&D guide will fall apart. You will oftentimes forget these questions, so write them out and don’t forget to address them!_** 
- Are your society and world a low magic setting making magic hard to come by? If so can a player still play a wizard even if it will be difficult?  
- How will you roll stats? 3d6 in order (hardcore!), 3d6 choose stats, 3d6 with one free 18, 4d6 drop the lowest, 4d6 reroll ones and drop the lowest? Point buy? Standard Array? Something else?
- You have to figure out how this is going to happen, and if the players are fine with it (3d6 in order is a bit harsh and not for everyone) or how your game is going to be because of these stats. 4d6 drop the lowest and reroll ones means the enemies they face will be more powerful than a 3d6 in order game.  
- What books are allowed? Just the basic books, or every book? Will you allow homemade classes, view them on a case by case basis, or say no? Cover all your bases here.

- # The Party
- Now that the characters are made, how will you start the game? Does everyone know each other? If so how do they know each other?  
- Does the party only have a few pairs that know each other? If so how will you get them all into one spot and why would they form a group?  
- Does no one know anyone? If so how will you get these random misfits to form a party? Will you make a table rule that everyone knows and they should just go along with it? Does each character have the desire to be an adventurer?  
- Can people be evil? How will backstabbing each other work? Is there no in-party fighting? What are the limits?  
- Make sure that these questions are answered and given to the players.

- # Out of Table Session 0s
- Sometimes we do all of this outside of the table. We do this over email, text, or the like and need to make sure everyone is on the same page. If you do this, make a group conversation and tell everyone. This way, if you tell someone something there will not be a ‘oh that’s right I forgot to tell you’ conversation.  
- If you hold your DnD session 0 over online connections and have the players make their characters beforehand that is fine, just make sure you have a session 0.  
- Do not expect to play a game when you have your session 0, but have a small scenario ready. If you made characters away from the table, you should have answered all these questions in a group conversation. If you have not, do this before you start playing.  A session 0.5 can be done after session 0 to set up how players will be meeting in session 1.
- Do not rush session 0 to get into the campaign. The perfect session 0 D&D guide foundation is extremely important to have or these questions will come up and play will be hampered.

- # Covering Your Bases
- We cannot be perfect or cover everything, so we have to be ready for when we screw up. If a player doesn’t like a rule, they can talk to you out of game right? Or did you say in-game? Either way, this sets a precedent for how players should respond when you do something they do not like. 
- **Ask your players**  
- You have to be ready to answer any and all questions that the players have as well. This is not just a one-sided monologue, and players have their own questions. They may ask what they know of the world already, and you have to give them that information.  
- Lastly, ask if there is anything else that the players wish to know just so that you all are clear. You have given them a lot to think about, but they may still have more questions. Answer them, and you will all hopefully have an amazing game!
